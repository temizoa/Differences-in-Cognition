# Anil Temiz - Differences in Cognition

The University of Maastricht has come to us to help them gain a deeper understanding of a "Five-Point test" that they have administered to roughly 1500 young individuals via computer-based assessments.

They have collected data on each participant’s performance during the test. This data consists of for example: their clicked selections, timing of each click, and time spent on each answer. The data also has results from participants’ CITO-score and Big-5 Personality test.

The aim here is to move beyond the traditional outcome measure of the test, which is the total number of correct answers completed in any given time frame. While this does give some insight, it has significant limitations in further analyzing and assessing one’s performance.

This is where our main objective grows from. We want to focus on what happens in a more nuanced form during the test itself. We want to identify patterns, such as the sequence of figures the participant chooses or maybe changes in speed, based on factors like figure relationships or errors made during the test.

These patterns can lead to new scoring metrics, and with that hopefully bring more insight to assist psychologists in better understanding the test-taker’s cognitive process.

Getting a better idea about this is important as it can uncover potential challenges a young individual might face and show where they may need more assistance (e.g, school).

Next to a better understanding, we also hope to bring new metrics that can bring in additional insight. For example, metrics that make it possible to analyze if there is a possible correlation between strategies used and certain personality traits of the young individual.
